industrial automation

Installation
------------
If you have windows, get MinGW before continuing.

To build the server, run `make` or `make all`. This will build the `ReaktorServerCLI` program which can be run normally. (See [Usage](#usage))

You can also `make install` to install this unfinished, useless, buggy piece of software to your `/usr/local/bin/` at your own peril. This probably requires some heightened priviledges.

Usage
-----
The software is infantile, it cannot do anything at all yet.
